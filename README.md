#  Mumbai Toxicity Filter - v1.0  
> _Detecting region-specific slurs and toxic Hinglish chat in real-time._

---

##  What is this project?

> A targeted solution to **detect and analyze toxic chat patterns** on Indian multiplayer game servers — specifically **Valorant Mumbai**.  
This project aims to address online abuse in region-specific forms: code-switched Hinglish slurs, cultural insults, and behaviorally toxic messages.

---

##  Goals

> **Long-term mission:**  
Build a highly accurate, explainable, and modular filter that can **flag**, **analyze**, and **visualize** toxicity trends across Indian game servers, beginning with Mumbai.

> **Version 1 (this release):**  
 Initial prototype — rule-based + ML hybrid  
 Code-switched text preprocessing (basic)  
 Hinglish slur normalization using slang dictionary  
 Basic ML classifier trained on mock data  
 Real-time prediction script (command-line)  
 Project modularized with preprocessing, training, and prediction scripts  
 Initial trend analysis notebook (`notebooks/analysis.ipynb`)
